          <h2>"The Beginning of a New Journey" - April 6, 2025</h2>
            <p>During July 2023, I realized I was living a life that didn't bring me joy - constantly running, never knowing where to. So I left it all behind and began a journey to find what truly excites me.</p>
            <p>Over the next year, I explored everthing from plants and their uses to the depths of psychology. And in that process, I discovered something life-changing: I have undiagnosed ADHD and Autism.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, so many things made sense.</p>
            <p>During that time, I also stumbled upon coding - and fell in love with it. My brain sees the world in visuals and patterns, and coding lit up that part of me like nothing else. I've always loved puzzles, solving problems, and uncovering how things work - and here was a whole world built on that.</p>
            <p>This is where I found my niche...my future.</p>
            <p>That moment marked the end of one journey - and the beginning of a brand new one.</p>

          <h2>"The Climb Between the Breakthroughs" - April 20, 2025</h2>
            <p>I'm not going to sit here and pretend this journey has been easy.</p>
            <p>There have been high days - days where I felt unstoppable, like I could conquer anything. But there were also the low ones. The ones where I felt like I'd made the biggest mistake of my life. Days where I questioned everything. Where I felt like life's greatest failure.</p>
            <p>But here's the part that matters: I NEVER GAVE UP!</p>
            <p>I pushed through the overwhelm, the doubt, the exhaustion. I've learned and grown more than I ever thought possible.</p>
            <p>Take Git and Github, for example - when I first started, it felt like trying to read hieroglyphs on a spaceship. I was lost. But now? I can almost do it with my eyes closed. (Almost.ðŸ˜‚)</p>
            <p>And coding? It's been wild. Writing lines of code and seeing them come to life...it never gets old. Finding bugs, hunting down problems, and finally - finally - watching everything click into place. There's nothing quite like it.</p>
            <p>Sure, I still have a lot to learn. But for the first time in a long time, I'm not afraid of the challenge - I'm exited by it.</p>
